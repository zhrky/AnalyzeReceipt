# AnalyzeReceipt

Using the instructions here, you can analyze your own receipts using the Azure Document Intelligence service, PowerApps, and PowerAutomate.

## Prerequisites
- [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence) resource 
- [PowerApps](https://www.microsoft.com/tr-tr/power-platform/products/power-apps) 
- [Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-automate/) 
  
**Note** : For Power Automate & Power Apps free trial enough

## Step 1: 
Go to [Make.powerapps.com](http://Make.powerapps.com) and sign in then create blank app.

## Step 2:

## Step 3:
Add Second **button** from the **Insert** section.

a. Change the function of second button to **UpdateContext({locDevice:If(Camera1.Camera<Max(Camera1.AvailableDevices,Id),Camera1.Camera+1,0)})**.

## Step 4:
Change the function of **Camera1** to **locDevice**.

## Step 5:
Add **Image** from the **Insert** section.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b0aaa06-9074-4c8d-9cbe-a9dafcba2dea)

a. Change the function from **SampleImage** to **locPhoto**. (We are changing it with the variable we defined before.)

## Step 6:
Duplicate the **Take photo** button with copy and paste.
a. Change the name of the copy to **Sent to Cognitive Services**.

## Step 7:
Go to  [Make.powerautomate.com](https://make.powerautomate.com/) and sign in.

## Step 8:
Create **Instant cloud Flow** from the **Create** section.

## Step 9:
Give the Flow a name you want. Select the Trigger **Power Apps** like **AnalyzeReceipt**.

Note: If you are working with New Designer, you may see it with a different name.

a. Add a text input inside. You can fill it as follows.

b. Add a new step, select **Initialize variable**. Fill it as follows. For its value, take the variable you defined in power apps from **dynamic content**.

c. Add a new step, select **Initialize variable**. Fill it as follows. We will use this to remove the extra base64 part of the image we get in the next step.

d. Add a new step, select **Initialize variable**. Fill it as follows. For its value, add **last(split(variables('varImage'),variables('varSplittextValue')))** to the function section in the **expression** section.

e. Add a new step, select **Compose** component. Fill the Input section as follows. This text in JSON format is used to process an image, especially with Base64 encoding.

f. Add a new step, select **Analyze Receipt**. After entering the key and endpoints, add the output of the previous **Compose** component to the Content section.

Note: This requires an Azure Document Intelligence source. If you donâ€™t have one, you can create one from Azure AI Document Intelligence | Microsoft Azure.

g. Save the Flow and return to the Power Apps screen.

## Step 10:
Click on the **Power Automate** icon on the left panel in Power Apps. Here, select your own flow from the In your app section.

## Step 11:
Change the function of the Send to cognitive services button to the following. This way, we can call the flow.
Note: You should write your own flow name in the **Analyzedoc** section.

**UpdateContext({locFlowResponse:Analyzedoc.Run(locPhoto)});**
**UpdateContext({locCaptions: Table(ParseJSON(locFlowResponse.captions))});**
**UpdateContext({locTagnames: Table(ParseJSON(locFlowResponse.'tag-names'))});**

## Step 12:
After saving everything, you can start testing by taking photos from the camera in preview mode with f5.

## Step 13: 
You can check if the flow is working correctly from Power Automate.
